\usage{
ReadPDFs(path, .enc = "UTF-8", recursive = TRUE, use.crossref = TRUE,
  use.metadata = TRUE, progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{character; path to directory containing pdfs
  or filename of one pdf. \code{normalizePath} is used on
  the specified path}

  \item{.enc}{character; text encoding to use for reading
  pdf and creating BibEntry object. Available encodings for
  Poppler can be found using \code{system("pdfinfo
  -listenc")}.  The encoding must also be listed in
  \code{iconvlist()}.}

  \item{recursive}{logical; same as
  \code{\link{list.files}}.  Should pdfs in subdirectories
  of path be used?}

  \item{use.crossref}{logical; should an attempt be made to
  download bibliographic information from CrossRef if any
  Document Object Identifiers (DOIs) are found?}

  \item{use.metadata}{logical; should the PDF metadata also
  be used to help create entries?}

  \item{progress}{logical; should progress bar be generated
  when fetching from CrossRef?}

\value{
An object of class BibEntry.

\description{
This function creates bibliographic information by reading
the Metadata and text of PDFs stored in a user specified
directory using Poppler
(\url{http://poppler.freedesktop.org/}).  IF requested, the
function first searches for DOIs and downloads
\code{BibTeX} entries from \code{\link{ReadCrossRef}} if
DOIs are found.  If this is not requrested or a DOI is not
found for an entry, an attempt is made to build a BibTeX
entry from the metadata and text.
}
\details{
This function requires that the \code{pdfinfo} utility from
Poppler PDF \url{http://poppler.freedesktop.org/} be
installed.

This function will create only \code{Article} or
\code{Misc} \code{BibTeX} entries.

The absolute path to each file will be stored in the bib
entry in a field called \sQuote{file}, which is recognized
by \code{BibLaTeX} (though not printed by any standard
style) and can be used by the \code{\link{open.BibEntry}}
function to open the PDF in the default viewer.

If the keywords metadata field is available, it will be
added to the bib entry in a field \sQuote{keywords}, which
is recognized by \code{BibLaTeX}.
