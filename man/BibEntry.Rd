\value{
an object of class BibEntry
}
\description{
Provides a new class \code{BibEntry} which builds on \code{\link{bibentry}} to provide enhanced
  functionalilty for representing, manipulating, importing, etc. bibliographic information in BibTeX or
  BibLaTeX style.
}
\details{
The BibEntry objects created by BibEntry can represent an arbitrary positive number of references,
  as with \code{bibentry}, but many additional methods are defined for building and manipulating a database
  of references.

\section{Entry Types}{

  bibentry creates "bibentry" objects, which are modeled after BibLaTeX and BibTeX entries. The entry should
  be a valid BibLaTeX or BibTeX entry type.  For a list of valid BibTeX entry types, see
  \code{\link{bibentry}}.  BibLaTeX supports all entry types from BibTeX for backwards compatibility.
  BibLaTeX defines following entry types
  '  \itemize{
   \item \emph{article} - An article in a journal, magazine, newspaper, or other periodical which forms a
  self-contained unit with its own title.  Required fields: author, title, journal/journaltitle, year/date.
   \item \emph{book} - A single-volume book with one or more authors where the authors share credit for
  the work as a whole.  Required fields: author, title, year/date. (Also covers BibTeX @inbook).
   \item \emph{mvbook} - A multi-volume \emph{book}. For backwards compatibility, multi-volume books are also
  supported by the entry type @book.  Required fields: author, title, year/date.
   \item \emph{inbook} - A part of a book which forms a self-contained unit with its own title. Note that the
  profile of this entry type is different from standard BibTeX.  Required fields: author, title,
  booktitle, year/date
   \item \emph{bookinbook} This type is similar to \emph{inbook} but intended for works originally published as a
  stand-alone book.
   \item \emph{suppbook} - Supplemental material in a \emph{book}. This type is closely related to the \emph{inbook} entry
  type.
   \item \emph{booklet} - A book-like work without a formal publisher or sponsoring institution.  Required fields:
   author/editor, title, year/date.
   \item \emph{collection} - A single-volume collection with multiple, self-contained contributions by distinct
   authors which have their own title.  Required fields: editor, title, year/date.
   \item \emph{mvcollection} - A multi-volume \emph{collection}.  Also supported by \emph{collection}.
   Required fields: editor, title, year/date.
   \item \emph{incollection} - A contribution to a collection which forms a self-contained unit with a distinct
   author and title.  Required fields: author, editor, title, booktitle, year/date.
   \item \emph{suppcollection} - Supplemental material in a \emph{collection}.
   \item \emph{manual} - Technical or other documentation, not necessarily in printed form. Required fields:
     author/editor, title, year/date
   \item \emph{misc} - A fallback type for entries which do not fit into any other category.  Required fields:
   author/editor, title, year/date
   \item \emph{online} - An online resource.  Required fields: author, title, number, year/date.
   \item \emph{patent} - A patent or patent request.  Required fields: author, title, number, year/date.
   \item \emph{periodical} - A complete issue of a periodical, such as a special issue of a journal.  Required
   fields: editor, title, year/date
   \item \emph{suppperiodical} - Supplemental material in a \emph{periodical}.
   \item \emph{proceedings} - A single-volume conference proceedings.  Required fields: editor, title, year/date.
   \item \emph{mvproceedings} - A multi-volume @proceedings entry. Required fields: editor, title, year/date.
   \item \emph{inproceedings} - An article in a conference proceedings.  Required fields: author, editor, title,
   booktitle, year/date.
   \item \emph{reference} - A single-volume work of reference such as an encyclopedia or a dictionary.  Alias
         for \emph{collection} in standard styles.
   \item \emph{mvreference} - A multi-volume \emph{reference} entry.
   \item \emph{inreference} - An article in a work of reference.  Alias for \emph{incollection} in most styles.
   \item \emph{report} - A technical report, research report, or white paper published by a university or some
   other institution.  Required fields: author, title, type, institution, year/date.
   \item \emph{set} - An entry set. This entry type is special, see BibLaTeX manual.
   \item \emph{thesis} - A thesis written for an educational institution to satisfy the requirements for a degree.
   Use the type field to specify the type of thesis.  Required fields: author, title, type, institution,
   year/date.
   \item \emph{unpublished} A work with an author and a title which has not been formally published, such as a
   manuscript or the script of a talk.  Required fields: author, title, year/date.
   \item \emph{xdata} - This entry type is special. \emph{xdata} entries hold data which may be inherited by other
   entries. (Biber only.)
   \item \emph{custom[a-f]} Custom types (up to five) for special bibliography styles. Not used by the standard
    styles.
