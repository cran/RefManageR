the sorted BibEntry object

\description{
Sorts a \code{BibEntry} object by specified fields.  The possible fields used for sorting and
the order they are used in correspond with the options avaiable in BibLaTeX.
}
\details{
The possible values for argument \code{sorting} are
\itemize{
\item nty - sort by name, then by title, then by year
\item nyt - sort by name, then by year, then title
\item nyvt - sort by name, year, volume, title
\item anyt - sort by alphabetic label, name, year, title
\item anyvt - sort by alphabetic label, name, year, volume, title
\item ynt - sort by year, name, title
\item ydnt - sort by year (descending), name, title
\item debug - sort by keys
\item none - no sorting is performed
}

All sorting methods first consider the field presort, if available.  Entries with no presort field are assigned presort
value \dQuote{mm}. Next the sortkey field is used.

When sorting by name, the sortname field is used first.  If it is not present, the author field is used,
if that is not present editor is used, and if that is not present translator is used.  All of these fields are affected
by the value of \code{max.names} in .BibOptions()$max.names.

When sorting by title, first the field sorttitle is considered.  Similarly, when sorting by year, the field sortyear is
first considered.

When sorting by volume, if the field is present it is padded to four digits with leading zeros; otherwise,
the string \dQuote{0000} is used.

When sorting by alphabetic label, the labels that would be generating with the \dQuote{alphabetic} bibstyle are used.
First the shorthand field is considered, then label, then shortauthor, shorteditor, author, editor, and translator.
Refer to the BibLaTeX manual Sections 3.1.2.1 and 3.5 and Appendix C.2 for more information.
